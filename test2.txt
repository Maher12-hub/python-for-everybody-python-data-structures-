
so, i have already stated that so called society convey the thoughts that success in the educational life is the measures of intelligency..if 
this is true then what about those who completed their graduation from a renowned university with a great result but still not finding jobs
to settle their carrier.. i have seen many students who were not really well in their educational life, moreover somehow they just completed
their gradution.. but right now they are successful..they are doing someting well than the intelectual people..we can put intellegency and wisdom
into the same pot.. however a survey by the washington university showed that  among 60 persent intelligent person ,40 percent are wisdom and 20 
percent are successful.. what does this means..intelligency cant be measured by success..success is totally depend on the hard work, resiliency
in the effort, immense focus towards the goal, denying the failure and tending towarsd goals with more faster speed and so on.. these are the 
best measues for making a person successful..What will be happened if one person is utmost intelligent,but he doest have the resilency to do hard
work, and more precisely he cant bear the pain of failure.. then success would just be a dream for him...the founder of alibaba wwas failed many
times in his effort.he failed many times in his educational life.. somehow he completed his gradution..then he was casted from  many job companies also.
but he didnt lose his hopes. he was sticked with his dreams more strongly after every failure.. he was resilient in his hard work, in his endeavour..
this made him the richest person in the china...not his intelligency not his sensibility..
